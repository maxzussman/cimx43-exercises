      Speaking of Nirvana, it was there <br /><br />
      as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix <br /><br />There with my crooked teeth and companion sleeping, yeah<br /><br />
      Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought <br /><br />That could think of the dreamer that thought
      <br /><br />That could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of God <br /><br />I be dreaming of dreaming a
      thought <br /><br />That could dream about a thought <br /><br />That could think of dreaming a dream
      <br /><br />Where I cannot, where I cannot
